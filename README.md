# Sign

**Sign** is a web-based augmented reality (AR) application for learning and practicing **Filipino Sign Language (FSL)**. This was developed to promote the use of FSL by making learning more accessible and inclusive. The app provides users with 3D animated hand gestures overlaid in real-time on their body through the device’s camera.

This project was built with the core mission of **breaking communication barriers** between the Deaf in the Philippines and beyond. By leveraging AR technology, **Sign** offers a visual and immersive way to learn sign language particularly for those who may not have access to formal education or in-person interpreters.

## 🌏 International Recognition

This app was selected for presentation at two international conferences, recognizing its potential impact in education and accessibility:

- 🇹🇭 **22nd International Conference on Electrical Engineering/Electronics, Computer, Telecommunications and Information Technology (ECTI-CON)** – *Bangkok, Thailand*
